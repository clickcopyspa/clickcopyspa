# Permits
A management system for remembering numberplates for digital permitting.

This webapp runs directly from github using the source code you can see here. 

All data is stored in your browser's localstorage, so your data won't be remembered between devices, however, you can export the data from one device and import it to another.

Use the app at https://lindymad.github.io/permits/

## Countries

The numberplate styling is based on your selected country. The only options currently available are UK, USA, and Generic (the Earth icon). If you wish to add your country, please open an issue and be sure to include a link to the relevant country flag from https://www.flaticon.com/packs/countrys-flags and an idea of how it should look.</p>
