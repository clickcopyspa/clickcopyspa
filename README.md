# ClickCopySpa

A single page app that makes it easy to copy frequently used references to the clipboard.

This webapp runs directly from GitHub using the source code you can see here. 

All data is stored in your browser's localstorage, so your data won't be remembered between devices, however, you can export the data from one device and import it to another.
